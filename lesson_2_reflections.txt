What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, git creates the files it will need to track
your project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The Working Directory and Repository contain all the traced files. The Staging
Area only contain files that are part of a particular commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By adding only the files that are relevant to the commit.
