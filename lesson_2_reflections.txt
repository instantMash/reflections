What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, git creates the files it will need to track
your project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The Working Directory and Repository contain all the traced files. The Staging
Area only contain files that are part of a particular commit.
