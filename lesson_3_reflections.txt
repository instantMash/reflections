- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

When working on a project from more than one computer (ex. work and home).

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

In case someone else on your team has made edits to the remote repository.

- Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork exists on Github. It is still associated with the original repo.
  • Use when you want to share your changes with the original creator.
A clone is a local copy of a repo, pulled down from Github.
  • Use when you want to work locally.
A branch is a series of commits that are grouped in a Repo.
  • Use when you want to work on a repo with the intent to eventually merge
  your edits.

- What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the
remote stored locally?

You can work offline.
